# task 6
In this task i created my own game that works pretty simple! But to be honest is not as easy to win in my game. There are four streets (Краківська, проспект Тараса Шевченка, вулиця Стрийська, вулиця Козельницька) and three enemies (Gopnik(can beat you), soldier(can get you to army) and Oles(final boss)). You can only win if you answer to the Oles question right. But you also need to remember that in Kolegiym you can't take an alcohol so u will loos if you have one.
There are txt file with example of the game.
